    <h2>Key Features</h2>

    <h3>Item generation system</h3>
    <p>
        There are dozens of items in Bag Boy Blitz, each with many unique components, 
        some of which, like their collision shapes, can create bugs if created incorrectly. 
        To save time and eliminate room for human error, 
        I made a tool script which automates the process of adding new items.
        <br><br>
        Every item has an associated 2d array representing its shape on the game grid. 
        The dimensions of the array match the dimensions of the items, 
        where 0s represent grid tiles that aren't taken up while 1s represent spaces that are. 
        When I create a new item prefab object, the tool script uses an algorithm to generate 
        an array of coordinates from the 2d array which are used to 
        instantly generate the correct commission shape every time.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, the script takes the id of the object and searches the file system for 
        every asset that needs to be added to the prefab, such as sprites and animations. 
        This saves a significant amount of time by eliminating the need to 
        manually drag and drop 100s of assets between the file system and the editor

    <h2>Noteable Game Design</h2>

    <h3>Pillars of difficulty</h3>
    <p>Difficulty in Bag Boy Blitz is derived from four areas</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>item weight</li>
        <li>item durability</li>
        <li>quantity of items</li>
        <li>item shape. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I can control the difficulty of the game by adjusting these variables with every new item. 
        Each store theme leans into one area of difficulty and individual levels are designed to combine it with another 
        to create new challenges. For example, items in the aquatic theme lean into low durability for difficulty. 
        One character in the aquatic theme, the angler, introduces a new item with a strange shape. 
        The challenge of this level is to find a place to put this strangely shaped item that will keep it safe from being crushed
    </p>
    
    <h3>Item perks</h3>
    <p>Each store theme introduces a new game mechanic that leans into one pillar of difficulty </p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Winter theme (shape): Items have a chance of spawning frozen. Frozen items can’t be rotated</li>
        <li>Aquatic theme (durability): The store is flooded! Items placed at the bottom of the bag become waterlogged. 
            Waterlogged items decreases in durability</li>
        <li>Convention theme (quantity): the longer you take to clear through a customer, 
            the more tempted they'll be to grab more merchandise. More items means less space in the bag</li>
        <li>Underworld theme (weight): customers may buy a Medusa head item. 
            Medusa heads will petrify any item in their line of site. 
            Petrified items weigh more</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These themes are intended to keep the gameplay from being too repetitive by forcing the player to adjust their bagging strategy.</p>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>After every level, the player is scored in these criteria</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Pairs</li>
        <li>Number of bags used</li>
        <li>Number of crushed items</li>
    </ol>    
    <p>
        Based on their score, the player is given a letter grade. These grades are an optional challenge 
        to encourage replayability and add optional difficulty to the skilled player. To 100% the game, 
        the player must complete a “perfect” run of every level, where each bag is cleared in under 30 seconds, 
        every item is paired with a like item, the minimum bags are used, and zero items are crushed.
        <br><br>
        The reason for including this mechanic was this: when I opened the game to playtesters, 
        every single one of them struggled to complete even the first couple levels. 
        I realized that my perception of difficulty had been skewed by countless hours of play-testing. 
        I, for one, was worried the game didn't have enough challenge. The scoring mechanic was created to bridge the gap. 
        I lowered the difficulty required to complete each level, but added this optional layer of challenge for 
        players looking to master the stacking mechanics.
    </p>

    <h2>Art Direction</h2>
    <p>
        Bag Boy Blitz is meant to have a light hearted and silly tone. 
        A lot of care was put into the art to portray this tone visually with expressive, 
        easy to read sprites despite the game’s low resolution. Here are some examples of how I achieved this effect.
    </p>

    <h3>Keep it simple!</h3>
    <p>
        With such a low resolution, I had to make the most of the space I had. 
        Large shapes are colored with 4 colors maximum and detail is rendered minimally.
        This simpler art style evokes a more cartoonish look which contributes to the unserious tone of the game.
    </p>

    <h3>Bold colors</h3>
    <p>
        Bag Boy Blitz uses saturated, in-your-face colors. 
        You never see a true black, instead, every outline and shadow uses a dark version of that sprite's primary color.
    </p>

    <h3>Solid, blocky outlines</h3>
    <p>
        Conventionally, pixel art outlines skip corners to more accurately preserve the silhouette of the sprite. 
        For Bag Boy Blitz, I intentionally used solid outlines to create more blocky sprites, 
        enhancing the cartoonish quality of the art by deviating from the norm.
